## Security Practices

This repository implements several security best practices:

### Git Secret Removal

We performed a Git secret removal operation to eliminate sensitive API keys from the repository history. This process:

- Removed hardcoded credentials from the entire Git history
- Rewrote commits to eliminate traces of sensitive information
- Preserved repository functionality while eliminating security risks

### API Key Management

- All API keys are now stored as environment variables
- No sensitive credentials are hardcoded in the source code
- Vercel environment variables are used for secure deployment
